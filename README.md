# Project: Engineering Manager Transition ðŸ”¢

> This is a personal record of my activities, events and learnings that will help foster an EM mindset. -  Chris Ngo

### Usage
Employ this document to keep track and plan ahead on weekly objectives. Make time to fill this out at the end of every work-week to validate current progress, jot down nuggets of knowledge and schedule for the next cadence. This will likely start out as a place for task and notes. Ideally, with enough organization and content, this will become my own knowledge base.

##### Notes #####
- This week is focused on answering the question <strong>"how can we deliver value to the customer incrementally?"</strong>
    - I want to encouage my teammates to <strong>approach each ticket as if they have their own MVP phase rather than default to the urge of feature completeness.</strong> I will start advocating for this in our Sprint Planning and future ceremonies. My goal is to have Luna start internalizing this way of thinking.
    - Reducing the scope of tickets to an "MVP" level will have a beneficial trickle-down effect. It sets clear boundaries on the incremental targets which makes developing and testing straightforward and predictable.
        - Furthermore this will help accelerate the customer-feedback loop. <strong>The sooner we can get value out to the customer, the quicker we can iterate and improve on their feedback.</strong>
    - We can apply the Gherkin writing principles to break down user stories. This helps us <strong>realize the scope and customer value of each segment. Most importantly, it gives us a better sense of what should be prioritized.</strong>

##### Notes #####
- Led Backlog Grooming and Scrum Ceremonies.
- Partipcated in the Context Meeting between EMs. This was a great opportunity to learn more about my fellow EMs, their pods and what we should collectively advocate for in FloQast engineering.
    - This week's conversation was predominately focused on Lead Time and how to organize cross-team epics.
- This Manager Training provided by Lifelabs was especially enlightening.
    - In the first hour, we learned about coaching philosophies and techniques.
        - Most often, we want our direct reports to be affirmed of their thoughts and help them arrive to a solution. 
        - Great coaches will usually ask around 10 questions in a span of 15 minutes.
        - The `Playback` technique is a way of reflecting what our teammate said to confirm whether their thoughts align with our initial understanding.
        - The `Split Tracks` is a way of helping both the coach and teammate determine whether there is more than one problem or conversation.
        - The `Soon Funnel` is a theoretical series of questions that can be applied to help our teammates reach an outcome that can be a solution or action-item. It is encouraged to Playback and Split Tracks aftre each question.
        <img style="margin-top:10px; width:50%; max-width:500px;" src="soon-funnel.png" alt="soon-funnel"/>
    - In the second hour, we split into breakout rooms to apply these learnings.
        - In groups of 3, we had a seeker, coach and observer.
        - The seeker would come to the coach with a problem or question that they want to discuss.
        - As the coach, our objective is to ask the right open-ended questions to enrich the context and understanding of the discussion for both parties. Coaches were not allowed to provide advice.
        - The exercise would be successful if the coach could apply these techniques to navigate the discussion to a happy path. Ultimately, a solution was not required, but at the minimum there should be a conversation that is trending into the direction of one.
- Organized meeting to outline Shield Duty responsibilities as part of Luna's Working Agreement.
    - Ironed-out expectations of the role, including the communication we should have with the team and the willingness to engage with the customer.
    - Teammates came up with a valid triaging process to handle bugs and issues that are encountered in the sprint.
- Fruitful discussions in our first EM Cohort Sync. We delved into a few crucial topics which include:
    - Reflecting on our reading material with emphasis on Resilient Management.
    - Examples of how to engage with a teammate who may be having trouble aligning with FloQast's culture.
        - Stick to the facts and make an astute observation. Ask caring questions to understand the problem. In doing so, we can give actionable feedback.
    - Fighting the urge to give "Tech Lead" answers to questions in team discussions. As Tech Leads, we tend to have the most domain knowledge in our particular area so our team relies heavily on our input. When we vocalize our thoughts, they typically become the dominating opinion. We need to give our teammates the opportunity to formulate their own opinions and communicate them to the fold.
- In the [The Gorilla Tax thread](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1332065861813694465?s=21&t=0Dk6Y-PZFqMQvFE00vkytg), Shreyas Doshi helps us understand intrisinc costs that large companies deal with. These are not necessarily monetary costs, but abstract costs that come from operating as such a organization:
    - Collaboration Tax - The cost incurred when large feature teams cannot come together to create a seamless solution. The pitfall can originate from lack of time, competing objectives or resource inavailability.
        - Startups can capitalize on this by meeting the demands for these distinct features before Gorilla companies can.
    - Denominator Tax - The cost of prioritizing breadth of usage over depth to meet a plethora of OKRs. Think companies like Google & Microsoft.
        - Startups can feasible take market share by prioritizing features that give customers the most value and filling in the gaps missed by the Gorilla.
    - Novice User Tax - The cost of having a product that's too difficult to use. This disincentivizes large organizations from making features more suited for Power Users. Cannot explore depth without the opportunity cost of reaching to a broader audience.
        - Startups can position themselves to provide those feature alternatives for Power Users.
    - User Restraining Tax - The cost incurred by having a product with heavy usage. Gorillas cannot quickly iterate upon a UI revamp. The backlash from users will ensure that it happens slowly or not at all.
    - Business Model Tax - The cost of using the same business or pricing model. The more successful the current one is then the less flexible they will be. 
    - Dogma Tax - The cost of drinking the Koolaid for too long. The original belief system may no longer be valid and companies need to adapt to the new meta.
        >  "At some point, a Gorilla becomes its own biggest customer. This means that, despite its various advantages, it cannot be as attuned with its real customers' needs as you can be as a Startup."
    - The graph visualizes the crossover point when a company starts to prioritize the organization and advocacy of proposed work over the production of it.
    <img style="margin-top:10px; width:100%; max-width:1000px;" src="company-work-prioritization-graph.jpeg" alt="company-work-prioritization-graph"/>
        - Startups typically are focused on producing work and value (red line).
        - Gorillas spend more time creating the structure, consensus and processes to generate future work (blue line).

##### Notes #####
- Led Sprint Planning and Scrum Ceremonies.

- Had informative 1:1s with Luna teammates.
- Shreyas Doshi introduces the <strong>Radical Delegation Framework</strong> to help prioritize work that must be done, how to best empower your team, avoid burnout and make a major impact. It is a variation and supplement to the Eisenhower Matrix, but it <strong>moreso emphasizes coaching and identifying the compatible opportunities to grow your teammates through proper delegation contracts.</strong> The framework involves 4 quadrants that align with the following principles:
    - Focus deeply yourself - If something has high impact and only you can do it > Do it then share your discoveries.
    - Setup the essential foundation - If something has low impact and only you can do it > Do it then coach a team member as they do it.
    - Delegate to most suitable person - If something has high impact and many people can do it > Delegate and monitor actively.
    - Delegate and forget - If something has low impact and many people can do it > Delegate but clarify that you are always available to help.
- Shreyas encourages leaders to embrace <strong>Placebo Productivtity</strong> by completing the tedious tasks 2-3 days before diving into our scheduled deep work. This will give us the dopamine of knocking out the lower-hanging fruit and give us the Flow to work on more impactful tasks.
- :bulb: **Tip**: Managers may too often be concerned with ROI and making small incremental wins to improve productivity. This can manfiest as people or teams whom are always busy but don't necessarily make a major impact. Instead, we should be focused on minimizing our Opportunity Costs to create long-term value. In short, that means to realize the cost of not doing something that has high impact and significant long-term implications. We could instead be focusing on that right now. With an Opportunity Costs mindset we move with actual intent.
    > "Your goal should not be to get a positive ROI on your time. Your goal should be to minimize Opportunity Costs. ROI thinking favors quick wins Opportunity Cost thinking favors big wins. Opportunity Cost thinking requires you to focus on the highest impact things you could possibly work on and then make those things happen." - Shreyas Doshi
- Gergely Orosz describes <strong>product-minded engineers as a critical ingredient to building successful products.</strong> They are interested beyond its implementation. They have the curiosity to explore why decisions are made, how people use the product and possess the customer-empathy to enrich the user journey. Their inquisitiveness helps deepen the overall understanding for the team.      
    - They ask thought-provoking questions like:
        - Why build this feature for the product, why not the other one?
        - Why ship this first milestone, instead of choosing another one, that's a lot simpler to build?
        - How will things be measured - why don't we choose a more thorough way to measure things?
    - Product-minded engineers have the unique ability to consider the impact a product decision has on both the engineering ecosystem and the customer experience. <strong>When evaluating new decisions, they consider the amount of time and effort required. They are focused on the "minimum lovable product" concept.</strong> They come up with solid middle-ground decisions that can provide immediate value to the customer while still being mindful of edge-cases and opportuniies for future enhancements.
    - They take ownership of the end-to-end product feature. It is not enough for them to simply deliver a solution, but they must know "How is my work really doing?". <strong>As engineers develop their skills through consistent application, product-minded engineers enhance their product instincts by being persistent and relentlessly following-up on their contributions as they navigates through the product-lifecycle.</strong>
- :memo: **Exercise**: Created my own Eisenhower Matrix and prioritized my tasks accordingly for the current sprint. This exercise was enlightening. I naturally am inclined to feeling like everything is Urgent and Important, but this helped me get a better of sense of my unique role and what tasks I should do to best help my team. Learning how to delegate is a skill I will continue to build on.
    > "Delegating tasks is one of the most efficient ways to manage your workload and give your team the opportunity to expand their skill set."

##### Notes #####
- Led Backlog Grooming and Scrum Ceremonies.
- Facilitated roadmap calibration (EM/EL/PM sync).
- Observed Europa Sprint Planning and shadowed Vinoj.
- Translated a new high-priority objective from Product leadership into an epic. Communicated new epic to teammates, provided context on the problem-statement and clarity on why we've prioritized this over WIP. Collaborated with teammates to iron-out an ERD and action-plan that will be executed over phases - Luna engineers formulated their own SWAG based off their understanding of the required scope.
- In [Product vs Feature Teams](https://www.svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/), Marty Cagan describes how top-down decision-making can create dehabilitating consequences to teams.
    > "When youâ€™re given output to deliver you are not empowered in any meaningful sense."
- <strong>In a "feature team", their stakeholders make the decisions on what to work on.</strong> They will say something like "build this feature because it delivers value to the business." Unfortuantely, in this type of relationship, stakeholders will still find a way to blame the team if their hoped-for results are not realized. Each member of the squad is negatively affected:
    - Product Managers devolve into project managers. They are <strong>stressed by this unfair reality and push for output instead of creating value for the customer.</strong> This manifests as a "show that you are busy" mindset.
    - Product Designers become graphic designers. They feel <strong>pressured to deliver designs that closely align with leadership's high-level vision.</strong> They don't have the opportunity to think and end up neglecting the app's usability and experience.
    - Engineers are <strong>regulated to an arm of execution and have little input on the "Why" for decisions.</strong> This creates a contentious relationship with Product. Both parties see each other more as obstacles rather than a contributing partner.
- In summary, "Product teams" degenerate into "Feature teams" when <strong>they don't have the agency to formulate their own priorities and make collaborative decisions.</strong> They don't feel like they own their product.
- :memo: **Exercise**: How would you indoctrinate an engineer who has never been on a "Product Team"?
    > <br>
    > <p>One of the best actions we can take is to keep them informed, always. Engineers are <strong>motivated when they have a say</strong>, but first we need to provide them the necessary context to formulate their own perspectives. Share why decision were made, why they matter - then be open to address their feedback. Establishing this line of communication sets the foundation for a two-way conversation.</p>
    > <p><strong>Be a Listener!</strong> Ultimately, we want our teammates to feel like they belong and that their opinions do matter in the execution of our goals. We can start breaking that ice in our 1:1s, which is arguably the most powerful method in our arsenal. We can learn a great deal by simply asking questions to get to know them better.</p>
    > <p>Wnat do you enjoy most about being an engineer?</p>
    > <p>What do you like about the product/feature that you're working on?</p>
    > <p>What don't you like about it? What are some cool enhancements you'd like to make?</p>
    > <p>These are concrete conversations that we can have to <strong>better understand their point of view and help foster any ideas that require feedback or affirmation.</strong> In doing so, we help build their self-assurance (Am I competent?), familiarity with their work (Am I on the right track?) and overall psychological safety (Am I valued?). <strong>Gradually, our "new" engineers will feel more empowered to discuss and share their perspectives with a larger audience, our collective team.</strong> They begin to indoctrinate themselves.</p>
    > <br>
- :tada: **Reflection**: This was my first week having 1:1s with my teammates as their EM. Previously, I had weekly 1:1s with them as a peer. It genuinely feels different, but in a good way! This time was usually spent helping them remove any blockers and gathering feedback on anything they wanted to chat about. This time, the conversations were more fluid and my teammates were engaged in asking questions outside of their WIP. I believe some ambiguity existed in our prior meetings as to their intended purpose. This week, I took care to endorse our new work relationships and corroborate on preferable 1:1 schedules/formats. I also employed the [Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) from Lara Hogan's Resilient Management. My teammates were really open to answering them and I'm fortuante to learn what they care about!

- Marty Cagan outlines the roles of leadership and management to cultivate [Empowered Product Teams](https://www.svpg.com/empowered-product-teams/).
    - Leadership should inspire and motivate the organization with a clear vision. 
    - By extension, management should effectively communicate that vision to their teammates and provide them the support they need to execute it. 
    - But first, a foundation of trust must be established. Leadership should trust their teammates have the competence to deliver value that aligns with their vision and priorities.
    - Management has the unique role of hiring people with the right blend of <strong>competence and character</strong> to meet these objectives. He recommends to <strong>keep the candidate pool large and employ the "No Assholes" rule.</strong>
        - A competent team with no assholes can establish the necessary trust with their teammates and with the rest of the company.
        - <strong>DON'T hire for "culture fit".</strong> Bringing in people who think differently than us will enrich the team and broaden our persepctive. We will learn new methods and approaches to solving problems. This ultimately is what drives diversity of thought.
    - <strong>Coaching is arguably the most important element to capable management.</strong> Managers should nurture and develop the skills of their people. We can be a good coach by:
        - Understanding their <strong>weekly progress and listening to their perspectives (1:1s).</strong>
        - Providing guidance on lessons learned. Use your technical prowess to <strong>help assess and give suggestions to design solutions that require your input.</strong>
        - Removing obstacles that block engineers from achieving their tasks. <strong>Help your engineers achieve their flow state.</strong> Engineers will benefit from not having to context-switch often. You can do this by:
            - <strong>Organizing meetings and ceremonies in a way that will not impede their momentum.</strong> They should be encouraged to put their headphones on and work without distraction.
            - Working with Product and the larger organization to prioritize objectives. <strong>Help communicate progress and set realistic goals.</strong> Engineers should be encouraged to focus solely on the task at hand without being burdended by competing initiatives.
        - Helping them "connect the dots." You can be a part of an engineer's learning and development without directly giving them answers - <strong>ask open-ended questions to help them reach the solution themselves.</strong>
    - Teammates should feel like they can take ownership over the objectives and have the autonomy to make grounded implementation decisions. An empowered organization will solve hard problems that will deliver value to their customers.
        >  â€œGreat teams are empowered to solve hard problems in ways their customers love, yet work for their business."

##### Notes #####
- Led Backlog Grooming and Team Health Check for our Slack Migration epic.
- :bulb: **Tip:** It is more <strong>efficient and effective to focus on a single initiative</strong> than to work on multiple in parallel.
    - Teams that swarm on a single initiative will <strong>benefit from sharing the same context</strong>. They can break down the goal into smaller, feasible tasks, enabling all members to contribute. Their constant collaboration will foster a clear understanding of the expectations, requirements and timeline. They are learning to <strong>optimize each other's time and abilities.</strong>  
    - Thereâ€™s a cost to context-switching when it comes to software development tasks. <strong>Switching tasks creates a mental burden on engineers.</strong> In turn, this can lead to confusion around expectations, frustration around lack of support and may diminish the quality of their product.
- Lara Hogan's [Team Leader Venn Diagram](https://medium.com/making-meetup/em-el-pm-venn-diagram-764e79b42baf) effectively illustrates the roles and intersections of members in a product team.
- Cynthia Maxwell's [Flow State Graph](https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/NoFkC0RjR5G2HLl84PCA_Flow%20Chart%202v.jpg) can be used in 1:1s to help us better understand our teammmates' perspectives around their current work-life. The non-threatening nature of this graph <strong>enables our engineers to comfortably assess themselves.</strong> As managers we can take that honest insight and calibrate our own expectations to resonate with the unique needs and goals of each teammmate.
